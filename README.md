Always wondered what the big companies like Google, Square or Twitter use when building their apps? Stop wasting your time ​writing boilerplate code and start using the power of code generation tools and ​libraries​ like AutoValue, Dagger, SQLdelight and Annotation processing.

For many developer the Angular 1 framework has been a huge boost in productivity. Having most of the tools needed to build an advanced data oriented application was a huge benefit. But Angular 1 is showing its age and is now replaced with a newer version. This new Angular 2 framework is not just an upgrade from the older Angular 1. Instead it is a complete from the ground up rewrite. This means we have to relearn quite a bit but Angular 2 is worth the effort. There are lots of improvements and Angular 2 has a bright future. In this session Maurice de Beijer will show you how to get started with Angular 2. He will show how and why it is different from its famous predecessor.

## Developers & Designers - Jordi Bruin

The collaboration process between developers and designers has always had a large impact on the overall success of a project. Over the last few years however, there have been many improvements in this area. More than ever, designers can express themselves in interactive prototypes and intricate design patterns. On the other hand, the mobile platform makers have given developers more and better tools to create mobile apps which fit well within the ecosystem such as Material Design. By letting design and development use the same tooling (GIT, Sketch and code) we’ve been trying to make our workflow more efficient. During this talk I will discuss the tools and workflows that we (try to) use at Triple to keep both developers and designers happy.

## Sharing Code Between Web and Native Apps - Sebastian Witalec

NativeScript has opened up a whole new world to Angular developers: the ability to share code directly between your web and native iOS/Android applications. Which is awesome! But, just because you can share code across multiple platforms, doesn’t mean that you necessarily should. In this talk we’ll first take a look at what NativeScript makes possible from a code sharing perspective. We’ll build a few Angular components and use them both in the browser and on mobile devices. Then we’ll take a step back and look at the same code from a pragmatic, maintenance-oriented perspective. Come for practical tips & tricks on sharing code across multiple development environments.

Ember-CLI, Angular-CLI, and Create-React-App are necessities to web development, and many who have not had exposure to such wonderful technologies wonder what they are actually missing. This talk will show you how easy it is to scaffold up all 3 projects in less than 30 minutes, how to shave days, even weeks, off your development cycle, and why you should choose convention over configuration.

The Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) Project—Google’s approach to fix the web for publishers—is barely one year old. It promises fast loading pages and an excellent user experience. Some people say it breaks the open web and whether you agree with it or not — looking at it technically, it is an interesting approach that offers many solutions. What problems do we face today? How does AMP solve these problems? Can we apply these solutions in our daily workflow? Let’s view the source and learn more!
